              Words cannot describe how happy I am today
              <br>
              I remember when we first met on WhatsApp this year
              <br>
              It didn't seem like a big deal then
            </p>

            <p>
              But we have been able to come this far by relying on each other
              <br>
              Thank you for always being there for me
              <br>
              Ready to listen to my nonsense talks and jokes
            </p>
          </div>

        <div class="row">
          <div class="text">
            <p>
              Even when they were not funny at all you still smiled
              <br>
              And when I was boring you still stayed
              <br>
              When I went through hard times, you were always there to cheer me up
            </p>

            <p>
              And you always saw the best in me even when I couldn't
              <br>
              This is something I cannot be able to repay you for
              <br>
              And so in return, I made your joy my joy (my top priority)
              <br>
              And your sadness my sadness (taking it as if it were happening to me)
            </p>

              You have a heart of gold, Praise
              <br>
              And your smile, it brightens up my day
              <br>
              Every moment I spent with you is a treasure to me
              <br>
              One that I will cherish for the rest of my life
              <br>
              I look forward to many more years with you
              <br>
              Happy birthday, baby girl
              <br>
              Love, Yemi mi.

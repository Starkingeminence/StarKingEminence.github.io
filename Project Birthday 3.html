            The first day i met you, at the library, to me you were just another beautiful girl
            <br>
            But you quickly showed me that there was more to you than i could ever imagine
            <br>
            "Do you have films on your laptop?" you said.
            <br>
            Laughs
            <br>
            Who would have thought that an introvert would talk to a total stranger
            <br>
            By then, i started to look at you in a different light
            <br>
            Maybe there was something more to this girl than i thought
            <br>
            Then you ask for my number and i was like were did this girl get courage from!!!
            <br>
            While feeling shocked, i accidentally get you a wrong number
            <br>
            I still blame myself for it, like how the fuck did i get my number wrong
            <br>
            But as fate would have it, we met again and you were just as beautiful as ever with that warm smile of yours
            <br>
            I remember feeling like i had butterflies in my stomach
            <br>
            But i had to keep my cool as i punched in your digits as i didn't want to start another wild-goose chase
            <br>
            I remember when finally we got talking, it was so fun, you even though i was funny which was not a side i even knew i had
            <br>
            I still have a smile on my face and sometimes even laugh anytime i go through those chats
            <br>
            And even though we didn't meet much and we fought alot, like aalloott, i remember promising you that i will always be there for you
            <br>
            So, Happy Birthday, Shade
            <br>
            I wish you all the happiness in the world
            <br>
            I hope you will never get sick
            <br>
            And that even in old age, you will still be like that beautiful, awesome girl, that i happened to meet at the library
            <br>
            Happy Happy Birthday, Library Girl
            <br>
            <br>
            Love, Adeyemi Library.
